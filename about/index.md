# About me
I'm a PhD student at the University of British Columbia in the bioinformatics program. Thoughts and mistakes here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the University of British Columbia or those of my colleagues and advisors.


Now that I have that out of the way, it's time for me to fill the rest of this about section with nonsense and profane swill that will lull you into a false sense of security. Hopefully, this will allow me to ambush you with glimpses of real information, insight, and my own sense of humor. The only common threads to this blog will be me, and hopefully some not-too-niche stuff about the problems I encounter while working.

I'm currently working in a mix of statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics as it applies to population genetics. A big focus of mine and the lab I'm a part of is the integration of multiple high-throughput biological assays. This constantly brings to new topics, and part of this blog will be there to ensure that I can communicate these ideas to a broader audience.

Enjoy parsing through what I have to say.

Profanity, nonsense, and filthy rotten swill to come (maybe).
